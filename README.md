# Minecraft Portal Project

Welcome to my Minecraft Portal Coordination Tool! This is a web application designed to assist Minecraft players in coordinating and visualizing their Overworld/Nether portal connections.

## Overview
The Minecraft Portal Coordination Tool helps players manage and visualize the connections between overworld and nether portals. 
It replicates the basic but hidden Java mathematics used in the game to predict and display portal connections based on user-inputted coordinates from both or either dimension.

## Features
- **Connection Prediction:** Input Overworld and/or Nether coordinates to predict portal connections.
- **Validation:** Validate portal connections to ensure proper linking and avoid one-way connections.
- **Interactive Interface:** Add, remove, and modify portal coordinates for analysis and visualization.
- **User Authentication (Future):** Integrate user authentication and storage for personalized portal management.

## Usage
1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/minecraft-portal-tool.git
     ```
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser.

2. **Portal Management:**
   - Input overworld and nether coordinates to see predicted portal connections.
   - Add, remove, or modify portal coordinates to analyze connections.
   - Explore the interactive interface to visualize portal placements and connections.

3. **Future Plans:**
   - Integration of user authentication and storage through a hosting backend service.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
